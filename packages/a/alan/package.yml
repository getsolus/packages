description: |
    The Alan System is one of the easiest-to-use tools for creating interactive fiction, aka text adventure games. The Alan System is based on a special purpose computer language designed to be easy to use for people more interested in authoring and designing games. The system consists of a compiler, which compiles Alan source code to a compact and portable format, and an interpreter which allows playing the compiled games.
