    <p>
      Boomaga (BOOklet MAnager) is a virtual printer for viewing a document before printing it out using the physical printer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program is very simple to work with. Running any program, click “print” and select “Boomaga” to see in several seconds (CUPS takes some time to respond) the Boomaga window open. If you print out one more document, it gets added to the previous one, and you can also print them out as one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether your printer supports duplex printing or not, you would be able to easily print on both sides of the sheet. If your printer does not support duplex printing, point this out in the settings, and Booklet would ask you to turn over the pages half way through printing your document.
