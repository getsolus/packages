### This file is managed by the Solus package manager. Do not edit, your changes will be overridden on future package updates.
## If you need to make changes to this file, you can do the following:
# 
## Prevent tmpfiles.d from re-creating the symlink (overriding your changes to the file)
# sudo mkdir -p /etc/tmpfiles.d/
# sudo ln -sv /dev/null /etc/tmpfiles.d/etc-nsswitch-conf.conf
#
## Copy the Solus-managed version of the file to /etc/
# sudo cp /usr/share/defaults/etc/nsswitch.conf /etc/nsswitch.conf
#
## Then you can make your changes to the /etc/nsswitch.conf as needed.
