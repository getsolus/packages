summary: Tiny and efficient C++/Python bindings.
description: |
    Nanobind is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa. It is reminiscent of Boost.Python and pybind11 and uses near-identical syntax. In contrast to these existing tools, nanobind is more efficient: bindings compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and have better runtime performance.
