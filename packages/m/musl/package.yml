summary: MIT implementation of the C Standard Library
description: |
    musl, pronounced like the word "mussel", is an MIT-licensed implementation of the standard C library targetting the Linux syscall API, suitable for use in a wide range of deployment environments. musl offers efficient static and dynamic linking support, lightweight code and low runtime overhead, strong fail-safe guarantees under correct usage, and correctness in the sense of standards conformance and safety. musl is built on the principle that these goals are best achieved through simple code that is easy to understand and maintain.
