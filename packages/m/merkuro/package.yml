description: |
    Merkuro Calendar is a calendar application that allows you to manage your tasks and events. Kalendar supports both local calendars as well as a multitude of online calendars: Nextcloud, Google® Calendar, Outlook®, Caldav, and many more. Merkuro gives you many ways to interact with your events. The month view provides an overview of the entire month; the week view presents a detailed hour-by-hour overview of your week; and the schedule view lists all of your upcoming events so that you can easily and quickly plan ahead. A tasks view is also available, making it possible for you to manage your tasks and subtasks with Merkuro's powerful tree view and its customisable filtering capabilities.
