description: |
    This is `mate-calc`, a fork of `gnome-calc`, the calculator application that was previously in the OpenWindows Deskset of the Solaris 8 operating system.

    It incorporates a multiple precision arithmetic packages based on the work of Professor Richard Brent, who has also kindly given me permission to make it available.
