Subject: [PATCH 11/27] clutter/actor: Introduce counter for painting in an
 unmapped branch

Just like the existing in_cloned_branch counter, add a property which
tracks whether the actor is part of a subtree that's being painted while
unmapped. This is going to be useful for a few things, for example
changing the clutter_actor_is_in_clone_paint() API to use
enable_paint_unmapped instead of in_clone_paint.
