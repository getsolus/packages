Subject: [PATCH 10/27] clutter/actor: Alway call queue_relayout() when showing
 actors

clutter_actor_queue_relayout() detects whether a parent has the
NO_LAYOUT flag set by itself and then queues a shallow relayout for us.
There's no need to duplicate that logic when showing actors, so simply
call clutter_actor_queue_relayout() and let that handle it.
