Subject: [PATCH] wayland/pointer-constraints: Warp pointer after destroying
 resource

e994fbf02 moved warping the pointer to before the destruction of the
resource to prevent dereferencing the constraint after destruction.
This however meant that the constraint was still active when the motion
event caused by the warp is handled, which would constrain the pointer
back again to its original position.

This moves the warping of the pointer back to after the destruction of
the resource and instead just retrieves the seat earlier while the
constraint is still valid.

Fixes: e994fbf02 ("wayland/pointer-constraints: Warp pointer before destroying resource")
Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/3696
