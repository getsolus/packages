        <Summary xml:lang="en">GGsimplecal is a lightweight calendar applet written in C++ using GTK.</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Gsimplecal was intentionally made for use with tint2
panel in the openbox environment to be launched upon clock click,
but of course it will work without it. In fact, binding the gsimplecal
to some hotkey in you window manager will probably make you happy.
The thing is that when it is started it first shows up, when you run
it again it closes the running instance. In that way it is very easy
to integrate anywhere. No need to write some wrapper scripts or
whatever. Also, you can configure it to not only show the calendar,
but also display multiple clocks for different world timezones.
