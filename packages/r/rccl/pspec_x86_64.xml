        <Summary xml:lang="en">ROCm Communication Collectives Library (RCCL)</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">RCCL (pronounced &quot;Rickle&quot;) is a stand-alone library of standard collective communication routines for GPUs, implementing all-reduce, all-gather, reduce, broadcast, reduce-scatter, gather, scatter, and all-to-all. There is also initial support for direct GPU-to-GPU send and receive operations. It has been optimized to achieve high bandwidth on platforms using PCIe, xGMI as well as networking using InfiniBand Verbs or TCP/IP sockets. RCCL supports an arbitrary number of GPUs installed in a single node or multiple nodes, and can be used in either single- or multi-process (e.g., MPI) applications.
