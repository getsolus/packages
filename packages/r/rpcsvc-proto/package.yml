summary: rpcsvc protocol definitions from glibc
description: |
    This package contains rpcsvc proto.x files from glibc, which are missing in libtirpc. Additional it contains rpcgen, which is needed to create header files and sources from protocol files. This package is only needed, if glibc is installed without the deprecated sunrpc functionality and libtirpc should replace it.
