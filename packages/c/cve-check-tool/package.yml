summary    : Vulnerability checker for Linux packaging
description: |
    cve-check-tool, as its name suggests, is a tool for checking known (public) CVEs. The tool will identify potentially vulnerable software packages within Linux distributions through version matching. Where possible it will also seek to determine (through a distribution implementation) if a vulnerability has been addressed by way of a patch.
