description : |
    Traditional full-bandwidth  codecs such as Vorbis and AAC can offer high
    quality but they require codec delays of hundreds of milliseconds, which
    makes them unsuitable  for real-time interactive applications like tele-
    conferencing. Speech targeted codecs, such as Speex or G.722, have lower
    20-40ms delays but their speech focus and limited sampling rates
    restricts their quality, especially for music.
