summary: a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool
description: |
    Icarus Verilog is a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It operates as a compiler, compiling source code written in Verilog (IEEE-1364) into some target format. For batch simulation, the compiler can generate an intermediate form called vvp assembly. This intermediate form is executed by the ``vvp'' command. For synthesis, the compiler generates netlists in the desired format.
