summary    : Intel SPMD Program Compiler
description: |
    ispc is a compiler for a variant of the C programming language, with extensions for single program, multiple data programming. Under the SPMD model, the programmer writes a program that generally appears to be a regular serial program, though the execution model is actually that a number of program instances execute in parallel on the hardware.

    # prevent us from using it, and the symbols we use have basically been there
