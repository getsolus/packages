To test `intel-compute-runtime`, an intel Skylake (6th gen i3/5/7-6xxx) CPU or newer is required.

Install `clinfo` and run it. It should display suitable information and not error out.

IFF the above works, install the `clpeak` benchmark and run it.

If both complete without error, intel-compute-runtime driven OpenCL is considered working.
