description: |
    Icmake can be used as an alternative to make(1). Icmake allows the programmer to use a program language (closely resembling the well-known C-programming language) to define the actions involved in (complex) program maintenance. For this, icmake offers various special operators as well as a set of support functions that have proven to be useful in program maintenance.
