Subject: [PATCH 2/3] ip: introduce the ecn_low per-route feature

Add a a new "ecn_low" feature that administrators can add to a
particular ip route. The ecn_low feature indicates that the given
destination network is a low-latency ECN environment, meaning both
that ECN CE marks are applied by the network using a low-latency
marking threshold and also that TCP endpoints provide precise
per-data-segment ECN feedback in ACKs (where the ACK ECE flag echoes
the received CE status of all newly-acknowledged data segments). This
ecn_low feature indication can be used by congestion control
algorithms to decide how to interpret ECN signals over the given
destination network.
