summary    : Compressed numerical arrays that support high-speed random access
description: |
    zfp is a compressed format for representing multidimensional floating-point and integer arrays. zfp provides compressed-array classes that support high throughput read and write random access to individual array elements. zfp also supports serial and parallel compression of whole arrays, e.g., for applications that read and write large data sets to and from disk.
