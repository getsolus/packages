        <Summary xml:lang="en">yq is a lightweight command-line YAML processor</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">A lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. yq uses jq like syntax but works with yaml files as well as json. It doesn&apos;t yet support everything jq does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more is being added continuously.
