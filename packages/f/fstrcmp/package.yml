summary: Library used to make fuzzy comparisons of strings and byte arrays.
description: |
    The fstrcmp project provides a library that is used to make fuzzy comparisons of strings and byte arrays, including multi-byte character strings. This can be useful in error messages, enabling the suggestion of likely valid alternatives. In compilers, this can reduce the cascade of secondary errors.
