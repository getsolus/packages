summary    : A large collection of free and portable video plugins
description: |
    Frei0r is a minimalistic plugin API for video effects.
    The main emphasis is on simplicity for an API that will round up the most common video effects into simple filters, sources and mixers that can be controlled by parameters.
    It is our hope that this way these simple effects can be shared between many applications, avoiding their reimplementation by different projects.
