summary: Fight Flash Fraud / Fight Fake Flash
description: |
    A fake flash drive fraudulently inflates its apparent storage capacity (far) beyond the physical capacity of its flash memory. Not surprisingly, using such a flash drive will, sooner or later, result in data loss and/or corruption. The main tools in this package are an open-source implementation of the H2testw algorithm. Some extra tools are also provided, among them one for using the actual storage capacity of fake drives as safely as possible.
