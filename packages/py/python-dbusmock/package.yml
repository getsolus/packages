summary: Mock D-Bus objects for tests
description: |
    With this program/Python library you can easily create mock objects on D-Bus. This is useful for writing tests for software which talks to D-Bus services such as upower, systemd, logind, gnome-session or others, and it is hard (or impossible without root privileges) to set the state of the real services to what you expect in your tests.
