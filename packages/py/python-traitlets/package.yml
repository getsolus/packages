description: |
    Traitlets is a framework that lets Python classes have attributes with type checking, dynamically calculated default values, and ‘on change’ callbacks. The package also includes a mechanism to use traitlets for configuration, loading values from files or from command line arguments. This is a distinct layer on top of traitlets, so you can use traitlets in your code without using the configuration machinery.
