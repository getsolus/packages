summary    : A Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format
description: |
    The h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the HDF5 library from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be a complete wrapping of the HDF5 API, while the high-level component supports access to HDF5 files, datasets and groups using established Python and NumPy concepts. A strong emphasis on automatic conversion between Python (Numpy) datatypes and data structures and their HDF5 equivalents vastly simplifies the process of reading and writing data from Python.
