summary: A lightweight LLVM python binding for writing JIT compilers
description: |
    llvmlite is a project originally tailored for Numba's needs, using the following approach:
        - small C wrapper around the parts of the LLVM C++ API we need that are not already exposed by the LLVM C API.
        - ctypes Python wrapper around the C API.
        - pure Python implementation of the subset of the LLVM IR builder that we need for Numba.
