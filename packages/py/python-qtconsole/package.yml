description: |
    A rich Qt-based console for working with Jupyter kernels, supporting rich media output, session export, and more. The Qtconsole is a very lightweight application that largely feels like a terminal, but provides a number of enhancements only possible in a GUI, such as inline figures, proper multiline editing with syntax highlighting, graphical calltips, and more.
