summary    : py.test plugin to abort hanging tests
description: |
    This is a plugin which will terminate tests after a certain timeout, assuming the test session isn't being debugged. When aborting a test it will show a stack dump of all threads running at the time. This is useful when running tests under a continuous integration server or simply if you don't know why the test suite hangs.
