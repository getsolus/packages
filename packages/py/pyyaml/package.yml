description: |
    YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages.
    
    PyYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for the Python programming language.
    
    PyYAML features
    
    a complete  YAML 1.1 parser. In particular, PyYAML can parse all examples from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple enough to be a reference for YAML parser implementors.
    Unicode support including UTF-8/UTF-16 input/output and \u escape sequences.
    low-level event-based parser and emitter API (like SAX).
    high-level API for serializing and deserializing native Python objects (like DOM or pickle).
    support for all types from the  YAML types repository. A simple extension API is provided.
    both pure-Python and fast LibYAML-based parsers and emitters.
    relatively sensible error messages.
