summary: Provides C-coded Python modules for fast multiple-precision arithmetic
description: |
    gmpy2 is a C-coded Python extension module that supports multiple-precision arithmetic. gmpy2 is the successor to the original gmpy module. The gmpy module only supported the GMP multiple-precision library. gmpy2 adds support for the MPFR (correctly rounded real floating-point arithmetic) and MPC (correctly rounded complex floating-point arithmetic) libraries. gmpy2 also updates the API and naming conventions to be more consistent and support the additional functionality.
