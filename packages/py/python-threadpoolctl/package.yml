summary: Python helpers to limit the number of threads used in native libraries that handle their own internal threadpool (BLAS and OpenMP implementations)
description: |
    Python helpers to limit the number of threads used in the threadpool-backed of common native libraries used for scientific computing and data science (e.g. BLAS and OpenMP). Fine control of the underlying thread-pool size can be useful in workloads that involve nested parallelism so as to mitigate oversubscription issues.
