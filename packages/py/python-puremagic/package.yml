summary    : Pure python implementation of identifying files based off their magic numbers
description: |
    puremagic is a pure python module that will identify a file based off it's magic numbers. It is designed to be minimalistic and inherently cross platform compatible. It is also designed to be a stand in for python-magic, it incorporates the functions from_file(filename[, mime]) and from_string(string[, mime]) however the magic_file() and magic_string() are more powerful and will also display confidence and duplicate matches.
