summary: Provides library functionality for communicating with a FIDO device over USB as well as verifying attestation and assertion signatures
description: |
    This library aims to support the FIDO U2F and FIDO 2.0 protocols for communicating with a USB authenticator via the Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP 1 and 2). In addition to this low-level device access, classes defined in the fido2.client implement higher level device operations.
