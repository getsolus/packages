summary    : Defer imports until used by code
description: |
    Often, especially for package modules, you want to import names for convenience, but not actually perform the imports until necessary. The zope.deferredimport package provided facilities for defining names in modules that will be imported from somewhere else when used. You can also cause deprecation warnings to be issued when a variable is used.
