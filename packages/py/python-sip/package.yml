summary    : python-sip is a tool that creates python 3 bindings for C and C++ libraries
description: |
    SIP is a tool for generating bindings for C++ classes so that they can be accessed as normal Python classes. SIP takes many of its ideas from SWIG but, because it is specifically designed for C++ and Python, is able to generate tighter bindings. SIP is so called because it is a small SWIG.
