        <Description xml:lang="en">SIP is a tool for generating bindings for C++ classes so that they can be
accessed as normal Python classes. SIP takes many of its ideas from SWIG but,
because it is specifically designed for C++ and Python, is able to generate
tighter bindings. SIP is so called because it is a small SWIG.
