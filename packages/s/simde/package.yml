summary    : Implementations of SIMD instruction sets for systems which don't natively support them. 
description: |
    The SIMDe header-only library provides fast, portable implementations of SIMD intrinsics on hardware which doesn't natively support them, such as calling SSE functions on ARM. There is no performance penalty if the hardware supports the native implementation
