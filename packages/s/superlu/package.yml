    SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of large, sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations. The library is written in C and is callable from either C or Fortran program. It uses MPI, OpenMP and CUDA to support various forms of parallelism. It supports both real and complex datatypes, both single and double precision, and 64-bit integer indexing
