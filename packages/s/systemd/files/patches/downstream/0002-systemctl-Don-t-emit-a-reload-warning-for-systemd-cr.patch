Subject: [PATCH 02/14] systemctl: Don't emit a reload warning for
 systemd-cryptsetup

This is modified by dracut during early boot, so instead of a nice clean prompt for the password, the user is presented with a scary warning about things being modified on disk, that they cannot possibly understand isn't actually a bad thing.

This simply skips all reload warnings for the transient dracut unit on Solus for systemd-cryptsetup, as this was generated *only* for the boot unit.
