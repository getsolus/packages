description: |
    libIDL is a library licensed under the GNU LGPL for creating trees of CORBA Interface Definition Language (IDL) files, which is a specification for defining portable interfaces.  libIDL was initially written for ORBit (the ORB from the GNOME project, and the primary means of libIDL distribution).  However, the functionality was designed to be as reusable and portable as possible.
