Subject: [PATCH 52/78] UBUNTU: SAUCE: apparmor4.0.0 [55/82]: fix profile
 verification and enable it

BugLink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2028253

This fixes a patch in the out of tree apparmor patchset that ubuntu
carries. This verification bug is two fold, first it triggers on
certain (but not all) policies that make use of the prompting feature,
resulting in policy load failures, second it causes regular policy
to not be verified. This difference from upstream in that upstream
is not carrying the prompting patchset.

The transition table size was not being set by compat mappings
resulting in the profile verification code not being run. Unfortunately
the checks were also buggy not being correctly updated from the old
accept perms, to the new layout.

Also indicate to userspace that the kernel has the permstable verification
fixes.
