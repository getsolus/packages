Subject: [PATCH 07/23] platform/x86: asus-wmi: ROG Ally increase wait time,
 allow MCU powersave
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The previous work to allow the MCU to be resumed correctly after sleep
and resume tried to take the shortest possible time. However as work
continues in various other parts of the s2idle subsystems it has shown
that it wasn't entirely reliable.

If the MCU disable/enable call is done correctly the MCU fully removes
its USB endpoints, and this shows as a full USB device reconnection on
resume. When we tried to short this as much as possible sometimes the
MCU doesn't get to complete what it needs to do before going to low-power
and this affected the reconnection.

Through trial it is found that the minimum time required is approx 1200ms
to allow a proper disconnect and disable, and the same amount of time on
resume is required to prevent a rapid disconnect/reconnect happening on
seemingly random occasions. To be safe the time is now 1500ms for msleep.
