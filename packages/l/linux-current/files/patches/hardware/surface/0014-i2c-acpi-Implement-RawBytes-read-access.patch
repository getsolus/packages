Subject: [PATCH 14/34] i2c: acpi: Implement RawBytes read access

Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and Book 1 devices access the MSHW0030 I2C
device via a generic serial bus operation region and RawBytes read
access. On the Surface Book 1, this access is required to turn on (and
off) the discrete GPU.

Multiple things are to note here:

a) The RawBytes access is device/driver dependent. The ACPI
   specification states:

   > Raw accesses assume that the writer has knowledge of the bus that
   > the access is made over and the device that is being accessed. The
   > protocol may only ensure that the buffer is transmitted to the
   > appropriate driver, but the driver must be able to interpret the
   > buffer to communicate to a register.

   Thus this implementation may likely not work on other devices
   accessing I2C via the RawBytes accessor type.

b) The MSHW0030 I2C device is an HID-over-I2C device which seems to
   serve multiple functions:

   1. It is the main access point for the legacy-type Surface Aggregator
      Module (also referred to as SAM-over-HID, as opposed to the newer
      SAM-over-SSH/UART). It has currently not been determined on how
      support for the legacy SAM should be implemented. Likely via a
      custom HID driver.

   2. It seems to serve as the HID device for the Integrated Sensor Hub.
      This might complicate matters with regards to implementing a
      SAM-over-HID driver required by legacy SAM.

In light of this, the simplest approach has been chosen for now.
However, it may make more sense regarding breakage and compatibility to
either provide functionality for replacing or enhancing the default
operation region handler via some additional API functions, or even to
completely blacklist MSHW0030 from the I2C core and provide a custom
driver for it.

Replacing/enhancing the default operation region handler would, however,
either require some sort of secondary driver and access point for it,
from which the new API functions would be called and the new handler
(part) would be installed, or hard-coding them via some sort of
quirk-like interface into the I2C core.
