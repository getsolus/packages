Subject: [PATCH 04/40] surface3-spi: workaround: disable DMA mode to avoid
 crash by default

On Arch Linux kernel at least after 4.19, touch input is broken after suspend
(s2idle).

        kern  :err   : [  +0.203408] Surface3-spi spi-MSHW0037:00: SPI transfer timed out

On recent stable Arch Linux kernel (at least after 5.1), touch input will
crash after the first touch.

        kern  :err   : [  +0.203592] Surface3-spi spi-MSHW0037:00: SPI transfer timed out
        kern  :err   : [  +0.000173] spi_master spi1: failed to transfer one message from queue

I found on an affected system (Arch Linux kernel, etc.), the touchscreen
driver uses DMA mode by default. Then, we found some kernels with different
kernel config (5.1 kernel config from Jakeday [1] or Chromium OS kernel
chromeos-4.19 [2]) will use PIO mode by default and no such issues there.

So, this commit disables DMA mode on the touchscreen driver side as a quick
workaround to avoid touch input crash.
We may need to properly set up DMA mode to use the touchscreen driver with
DMA mode.

You can still switch DMA/PIO mode if you want:

  switch to DMA mode (maybe broken)
        echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/surface3_spi/parameters/use_dma
  back to PIO mode
        echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/surface3_spi/parameters/use_dma

Tested on Arch Linux 5.4.1 with Surface 3, which will use DMA by default.
This commit made the driver use PIO by default and no touch input crash.
Also tested on chromeos-4.19 4.19.90 with Surface 3, which will use PIO by default
even without this commit. After this commit, it still uses PIO and confirmed
no functional changes regarding touch input.

More details:
  We can confirm which mode the touchscreen driver uses; first, enable
  debug output:

        echo "file drivers/spi/spi-pxa2xx.c +p" | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
        echo "file drivers/input/touchscreen/surface3_spi.c +p" | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

  Then, try to make a touch input and see dmesg log

        (On Arch Linux kernel, uses DMA)

Note (2025-03-08): This patch was originally dropped due to the
comments in [3]. However, according to the commments in [4] it is still
required.
