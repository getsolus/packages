Subject: [PATCH 34/40] media: i2c: dw9719: fix probe error on surface go 2

On surface go 2, sometimes probing dw9719 fails with "dw9719: probe of i2c-INT347A:00-VCM failed with error -121".
The -121(-EREMOTEIO) is came from drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-designware-common.c:575, and indicates the initialize occurs too early.
So just add some delay.
There is no exact reason for this 10000us, but 100us failed.
