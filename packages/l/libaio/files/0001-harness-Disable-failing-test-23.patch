Subject: [PATCH libaio] harness: Disable failing test 23
Origin: vendor
Forwarded: not-needed

This new test fails on several architectures. But it is a new test
intended to check for a Linux kernel regression, so we are not worse
off than were before. Add it to the EXTRACASES variables, which has
currently the side effect of disabling it, as it is not handled
explicitly in the make target responsible for that variable.

Sent-Upstream: not-relevant
