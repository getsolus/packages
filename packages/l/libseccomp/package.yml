summary    : High level interface to the Linux Kernel's seccomp filter
component  : system.base
description: |
    The libseccomp library provides an easy to use, platform independent, interface to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism: seccomp. The libseccomp API is designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based syscall filter language and present a more conventional function-call based filtering interface that should be familiar to, and easily adopted by application developers.
