summary: The project aims at providing a library to manipulate ABI corpora, compare them, provide detailed information about their differences and help build tools to infer interesting conclusions about these differences.
description: |
    This project aims at providing a C++ library for constructing, manipulating, serializing and de-serializing ABI-relevant artifacts. The set of artifacts that we are interested in is made of constructions like types, variables, functions and declarations of a given library or program. For a given program or library, this set of constructions is called an ABI corpus.
