summary: librsync is a library for calculating and applying network deltas, with an interface designed to ease integration into diverse network applications
description: |
    librsync implements the "rsync" algorithm, which allows remote differencing of binary files. librsync computes a delta relative to a file's checksum, so the two files need not both be present to generate a delta.
