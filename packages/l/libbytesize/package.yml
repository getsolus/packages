summary    : A tiny library providing a C "class" for working with arbitrary big sizes
    in bytes
description: |
    The libbytesize is a C library that facilitates work with sizes in
    bytes. Be it parsing the input from users or producing a nice human readable
    representation of a size in bytes this library takes localization into
    account. It also provides support for sizes bigger than MAXUINT64.
