Subject: [PATCH] Let QXcbConnection::getTimestamp properly exit when X server
 quits
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

QXcbConnection::getTimestamp uses dummy events to get timestamp from
X server. However, in some cases, X server shuts down while client tries
to get timestamp. In this case, QXcbConnection::getTimestamp keeps
getting null event and thus falls into indefinite loop.

This fix checks if xcb connection is still valid and use a special
xcb_timestamp_t value, CurrentTime (0L), as returned value.
CurrentTime should not be generated by X server and if getTimestamp
returns this value, it means an "exception" case is triggered.

This fix is introduced because in kwin_x11 (KDE project), X server can
exit on logout. kwin_x11 should handle disconnection from X server.
But the indefinite loop prevents kwin_x11 to process disconnection
event and therefore kwin_x11 cannot quit properly.

Fixes: QTBUG-88435
