summary: QDirStat is a graphical application to show where your disk space has gone and to help you to clean it up
description: |
    graphical disk usage display with cleanup facilities. QDirStat (Qt Directory Statistics) is a small utility program that sums up disk usage for directory trees, very much like the Unix 'du' command. It displays the disk space used up by a directory tree, both numerically and graphically. It is network transparent (i.e., you can use it to sum up FTP servers), and comes with predefined and user configurable cleanup actions.
