summary: Qt5 Webchannel Module
description: |
    The Qt WebChannel module offers Qt applications a seamless way to publish `QObjects` for interaction
    with HTML/JavaScript clients. These clients can either be inside local Qt `WebView`s or any other,
    potentially remote, client which supports JavaScript, as long as a communication channel such
    as WebSocket is available.
    Qt WebChannel uses introspection on the `QObject`s and sends this serialized data to the clients.
    There, with the help of a small JavaScript library, an object is created which simulates the API of
    the `QObject`. Any invokable methods, including slots, can be called as well as properties read and
    written. Additionally you can connect to signals and register JavaScript callbacks as handlers.
