        <Summary xml:lang="en">hwcaps-loader is a solution for dealing with optimized binaries in Linux distributions.</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Newer CPU variants bring new instructions and additional registers. The compiler can take advantage of those capabilities to generate more performant code. In particular, using vectorized code (SIMD processing in X86_64 and other architectures) can give a big performance benefit.
x86-64-v2 and x86-64-v3 processors are exceedingly common these days, and x86-64-v4 processors are also being sold, so providing optimized binaries is increasingly more important.
Typically, Linux distributions only ship a single version of every program... one with wide support for different hardware variants. This effectively means that code cannot be compiled in a way that requires newer optional CPU features. Unfortunately, this means that newer hardware often misses out on extra performance and lower latency.
