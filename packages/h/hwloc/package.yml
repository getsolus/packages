summary    : Helps applications gather information about resources on parallel computing platforms
description: |
    The Hardware Locality (hwloc) software project aims at easing the process of discovering hardware resources in parallel architectures. It offers command-line tools and a C API for consulting these resources, their locality, attributes, and interconnection. hwloc primarily aims at helping high-performance computing (HPC) applications, but is also applicable to any project seeking to exploit code and/or data locality on modern computing platforms.
