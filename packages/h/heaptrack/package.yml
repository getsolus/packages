summary: A heap memory profiler for Linux
description: |
    Heaptrack traces all memory allocations and annotates these events with stack traces. Dedicated analysis tools then allow you to interpret the heap memory profile to:

        - find hotspots that need to be optimized to reduce the memory footprint of your application
        - find memory leaks, i.e. locations that allocate memory which is never deallocated
        - find allocation hotspots, i.e. code locations that trigger a lot of memory allocation calls
        - find temporary allocations, which are allocations that are directly followed by their deallocation
