summary    : IEEE 754-based half-precision floating-point library
description: |
    half is a C++ header-only library to provide an IEEE 754 conformant 16-bit half-precision floating-point type along with corresponding arithmetic operators, type conversions and common mathematical functions. It aims for both efficiency and ease of use, trying to accurately mimic the behaviour of the built-in floating-point types at the best performance possible.
