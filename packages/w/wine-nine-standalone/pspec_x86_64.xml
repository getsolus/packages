        <Summary xml:lang="en">Gallium Nine Standalone</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Gallium Nine allows to run any Direct3D 9 application with nearly no CPU overhead, which provides a smoother gaming experience and increased FPS.

Gallium Nine Standalone, as the name implies, is a standalone version of the WINE parts of Gallium Nine.

This decouples Gallium Nine from the WINE tree, so that it can be used with any WINE version. There is no need for any WINE patches. A stable, development, or staging WINE release is sufficient.
