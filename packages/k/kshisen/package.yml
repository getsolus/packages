summary    : Shisen-Sho is a solitaire-like game played using the standard set of Mahjong tiles
description: |
    Shisen-Sho is a solitaire-like game played using the standard set of Mahjong tiles. Unlike Mahjong however, Shisen-Sho has only one layer of scrambled tiles.
    You can remove matching pieces if they can be connected with a line with at most two bends in it. At the same time, the line must not cross any other tiles.
    To win a game of Shisen-Sho the player has to remove all the tiles from the game board.
