summary    : Scheduling LIGHT/DARK Theme Converter for the KDE Plasma Desktop
description: |
    Koi is a program designed to provide the KDE Plasma Desktop functionality to automatically switch between light and dark themes. 
    Koi is under semi-active development, and while it is stable enough to use daily, expect bugs.
    Koi is designed to be used with Plasma, and while some features may function under different desktop environments, they are untested and unlikely to work . . .
