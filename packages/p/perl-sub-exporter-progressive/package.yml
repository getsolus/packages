summary    : Sub Exporter Wrapper
description: |
    Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes great responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties. This module is a Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your users just use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use Sub::Exporter if your users try to use Sub::Exporter's more advanced features, like renaming exports, if they try to use them.
