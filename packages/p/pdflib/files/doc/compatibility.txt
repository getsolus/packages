API changes
===========

This file documents those API changes which affect existing PDFlib client
programs. Although we go to some efforts in maintaining the existing API
functions, it is sometimes necessary to incorporate a few non-backward
compatible changes in order to streamline the API and incorporate new or
extended functions.


PDFlib, PPS API, and Block plugin versions

PDFlib 7.0.5
============
(No relevant changes)


PDFlib 7.0.4p12
===============
The PHP wrapper now honors the "basedir" setting in the php.ini file.
This can be considered an incompatible change, but on the other hand it
was a bug that PDFlib ignored a PHP security setting.


PDFlib 7.0.4p6
==============
Setting strokewidth=0 previously used the value of "underlinewidth",
but now refers to a builtin default. This may change the linewidth for
applications which do not specify any value explicitly, but the new
default creates much better results than the old behavior.


PDFlib 7.0.4p5
==============
The long deprecated function PDF_setpolydash() is no longer available
in the PHP 5.3 binding.


PDFlib 7.0.4
============
Changed the default for the suboption "inputformat" of the option "metadata"
(which is supported by various API functions) from "ebcdicutf8" to "utf"
on z/OS (incompatible change). iSeries is not affected.
Clients must either explicitly specify the desired input format of the
XMP file, or submit their XMP in UTF-8.


PDFlib 7.0.3
============
File names in option lists are now treated as hypertext strings. This can
be considered downward incompatible, but fixes problems which resulted in
non-working PDF output when file names (e.g. for GoToR actions) contained
non-ASCII characters which couldn't be mapped to PDFDocEncoding.

PDF_info_textline(): option "unmappedglyphs" is deprecated, use "unmappedchars".

Modifies the behavior in non-Unicode-aware language bindings for the
treatment of name strings in situation "hypertextencoding=unicode" and
"usehypertextencoding=true": depending on the BOM, PDFlib now expects
UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE (terminated with double null).
Previously name strings were treated as host-encoded strings, and UTF-16
strings would trigger an error message.


PDFlib 7.0.2
============

Changes the behavior of repeated calls to PDF_load_font() with the same
font/encoding in a slightly incompatible way: when a font is loaded with
the embedding option, but already has been loaded earlier without this
option, the call will fail (instead of silently ignoring the conflict in
the second call). This is important for filling blocks with embedding=true
if the same font has already been loaded earlier without embedding.

The exact behavior of PDF_load_font() depends on the errorpolicy setting:

errorpolicy=legacy: a warning will be logged
errorpolicy=return: -1 will be returned
errorpolicy=exception: an exception will be thrown.

The new behavior is incompatible for errorpolicy=return or =exception, but 
usually points to a problem in the application which needs to be fixed.


PDFlib 7.0.1
============

The codepages cp932, cp936, cp949, and cp950 for CJK text no longer use
Windows system codepages, but the standard CMaps. Therefore the CMaps
must be configured in PDFlib when using one of these codepages on
Windows (on other systems the CMaps were required in 7.0.0 already).


XMP metadata for PDF/A: only the predefined PDF/A schemas are allowed,
plus the four schemas required for defining extension schemas. This is
incompatible with PDFlib 7.0.0 (which accepted arbitrary custom schemas),
but the previous behavior can be considered a bug since it resulted in
output which did not fully conform to the PDF/A standard.


PDFlib 7.0.0
============

Font subsetting: the semantics of the "subsetting", "autosubsetting",
"subsetlimit", and "subsetminsize" options changed.

Text output: the improved font engine in PDFlib 7 checks whether the
glyphs required for creating text output are actually available in a
given font. Characters in a text string for which the selected font
does not contain the appropriate glyph will be replaced (for detailed
control see the glyphchecking and replacementchar options), while the
text strings were simply passed through by PDFlib 6 and earlier versions.
Although this feature improves the accuracy of text output, it may be
considered a small incompatibility (but only in situations which should
be avoided anyway).

Error handling: the new parameter "errorpolicy" allows for more
consistent control of exceptions and error returns. The default setting
is fully compatible with earlier versions, but we strongly recommend
to use the new errorpolicy=return setting, and adjust your application
(e.g. check the return value of PDF_load_font()).

The default PDF version compatibility has been changed to PDF 1.6. If you
need to create documents according to an older PDF version you must set the
"compatibility" option in PDF_begin_document() appropriately.

General functionality:
Clipping paths in TIFF and JPEG images will now be honored, while
up to PDFlib 6 they have been ignored. In order to restore the previous
("ignore path") behavior supply the option "honorclippingpath=false" to
PDF_load_image().

PDF/X-1:2001 is considered deprecated, and no longer supported.
PDF/X-1a:2001 and PDF/X-1a:2003 are still supported, though.


PDF_info_textflow(): The values for the keywords
leftlinex, leftliney, rightlinex, rightliney, minliney, maxliney
are now interpreted in current user coordinates, while in PDFlib 6 they
have been returned in user coordinates of PDF_fit_textflow(). 

The values for the keywords textendx, textendy
are now interpreted in current user coordinates, while in PDFlib 6 they
have been returned in user coordinates immediately after PDF_fit_textflow().

Required action if you are affected by this change:
Avoid any change of the current transformation matrix (e.g. PDF_scale(),
PDF_rotate(), PDF_translate()) between the calls to PDF_fit_textflow() and
PDF_info_textflow().

Exception handling:
The "warning" parameter is deprecated, and will be ignored. If you are
interested in non-fatal problems which can be fixed by PDFlib internally
enable logging with the "warning" class. 

Language bindings:
Python: there is a new version of the Python wrapper with integrated Unicode
support. An old-style Python wrapper without Unicode support is available
for compatibility with existing applications.
A new PDFlibException object is available in the PDFlib Python binding.
Code which caught "except SystemError" (instead of the recommended "except:")
must be changed to "except PDFlibException:".

Deprecated functions:

PDF_open_pdi() and PDF_close_pdi(): use PDF_open_pdi_document() and
PDF_close_pdi_document()
PDF_begin_template(): use PDF_begin_template_ext()
PDF_get_pdi_value(): use PDF_pcos_get_number()
PDF_get_pdi_parameter(): use PDF_pcos_get_string()
(pCOS paths corresponding to the keys of the deprecated functions can be
found in the PDFlib API manual).


Deprecated parameters:

Use PDF_info_font() instead of using the following deprecated parameters:
monospace
fontmaxcode
ascender
capheight
xheight
descender

fontname
fontencoding
fontstyle
ascenderfaked
capheightfaked
xheightfaked
descenderfaked

Use the PDF_load_font() option of the same name instead of the following
deprecated parameters:
autosubsetting 
autocidfont 
unicodemap 
subsetlimit 
subsetminsize

Use the "logging" parameter instead of the following deprecated (unsupported)
parameters:
trace
tracefile


Deprecated PDF/X output intents:

The following standard output intent names are deprecated, and should no
longer be used:

OF COM PO P1 F60,
OF COM PO P2 F60,
OF COM PO-P3 F60,
OF COM PO P4 F60,
OF COM NE P1 F60,
OF COM NE P2 F60,
OF COM NE P3 F60,
OF COM NE P4 F60,
SC GC2 CO F30,
Ifra_NP_40lcm_neg+CTP_05.00


Configuration incompatibility:

Using any of the predefined CMaps now requires the actual CMap file due
to extended text processing features. The CMap files are available for
download separately, and must be configured according to the documentation
(e.g. using the SearchPath resource category).

The "prefix" parameter and UPR entry is no longer supported (it had been
declared deprecated in PDFlib 5).

Deprecated options:
PDF_fit_textline(): weblink, locallink; use the matchbox feature instead

PDF_open_pdi_page(): infomode; use pCOS to query page properties without
actually placing the page


PDFlib Lite incompatibility:

Glyph widths for standard CJK fonts with Unicode CMaps are no longer
available due to the transition to external CMaps. PDF_stringwidth()
will return 0 in this case.

The resolution value is no longer read from JPEG images created with
Photoshop.

The following deprecated (as of PDFlib 6) functions have been removed from
the manual:

PDF_add_bookmark()
PDF_add_bookmark2()
PDF_add_note()
PDF_add_note2()
PDF_attach_file()
PDF_attach_file2()
PDF_add_pdflink()
PDF_add_locallink()
PDF_add_launchlink()
PDF_add_weblink()
PDF_set_border_style()
PDF_set_border_color()
PDF_set_border_dash()
PDF_open_mem()
PDF_open_file()
PDF_close()
PDF_begin_page()
PDF_end_page()
PDF_show_boxed()

PDF_boot() and PDF_shutdown(): these have never been functional, and
were only available in the C language binding.

The following deprecated (as of PDFlib 6) parameters have been removed from
the manual:

compatibility
pdfx
flush
openwarning
pagewidth, pageheight (PDF_set_value())
ArtBox/*, BleedBox/*, CropBox/*, TrimBox/*
userpassword
masterpassword
permissions
defaultgray
defaultrgb
defaultcmyk
pdiusebox
openaction
openmode
hidetoolbar
hidemenubar
hidewindowui
fitwindow
centerwindow
displaydoctitle
nonfullscreenpagemode
direction
viewarea, viewclip
printarea, printclip
bookmarkdest
transition
duration
base
launchlink:parameters
launchlink:operation
launchlink:defaultdir


The following unsupported functions have been removed (use PDF_info_font()
instead):

PDF_encoding_get_glyphname()
PDF_encoding_get_unicode()
PDF_get_glyphid()


PHP binding:
Parameter "imagewarning": the default has been "true" for historical reasons;
in PDFlib 7 it has been changed to "false" for compatibility with all other
language bindings.


PDFlib 6.0.3
============

- Textflow: if the box doesn't contain any text at all when processing is
  finished (e.g. because the width of the box is too small to hold any text),
  the return string "_boxfull" is misleading. Textflow will now return 
  the string "_boxempty" in such situations.

- New options:
  PDF_begin_item(): Scope attribute for TH items.
  PDF_begin/end_document(): moddate
  PDF_begin/end_document(): search

- New parameters:
  nodemostamp
  xheight
  xheightfaked
  capheightfaked
  ascenderfaked
  descenderfaked

- The block interface version number has been changed to 6; Block plugin 2.2
  or above is required for use with PPS 6.0.3.

- Deprecated options:
  PDF_create_action(), PDF_create_annotation(), PDF_create_bookmark(),
  and PDF_begin/end_document(): "name" option, "nameddest" suboption of the
  "type" option.



PDFlib 6.0.2
============

- New options:
  PDF_fit_textflow(): orientate
  PDF_create_annotation(): opacity, createdate, subject
  PDF_info_textflow(): leftlinex/y, rightlinex/y
  PDF_begin/end_page_ext(): metadata

- In order to work around different behavior in Acrobat 5 and 6 regarding
  several form field options (e.g. the readonly option for radio buttons
  was not honored in Acrobat 6) the following restriction is now implemented:
  options "readonly", "unisonselect", "toggle", and "tooltip" for type=
  radiobutton are only allowed for PDF_create_fieldgroup(), but no longer
  for PDF_create_field().
  Client code which used one of these options for PDF_create_field() created
  bad PDF output. Such code will now raise a warning unless fieldwarning=false,
  and thus should be changed to honor the new restrictions.

- The leading handling in PDF_create_textflow()/PDF_fit_textflow() has
  changed. Previously the behavior for multiple leading instructions on
  a line was undefined, and didn't match the user expectation in certain
  cases.  E.g. when leading was specified at the beginning of the text
  _and_ in the optlist parameter of PDF_create_textflow(), the leading
  value from the optlist parameter was used, and not the one from the inline
  option list.
  The new leading behavior is documented in the manual. In some situations
  it may cause different formatting results than with earlier versions, but
  the previous behavior is considered a bug.


PDFlib 6.0.1
============

- No changes which affect compatibility.


PDFlib 6.0.0
============

See the PDFlib manual for information about new functions and parameters
which should be used instead of the deprecated ones.

Deprecated functions:

- PDF_show_boxed(), PDF_show_boxed2()
- PDF_add_bookmark(), PDF_add_bookmark2()
- PDF_attach_file(), PDF_attach_file2()
- PDF_add_note(), PDF_add_note2()
- PDF_add_pdflink()
- PDF_add_locallink()
- PDF_add_launchlink()
- PDF_add_weblink()
- PDF_set_border_style()
- PDF_set_border_color()
- PDF_set_border_dash()

Deprecated options for particular functions:

- reftype in PDF_load_image()

Deprecated parameters:

- userpassword, masterpassword, permissions, compatibility, flush, pdfx
- openaction, base, launchlink:parameters, launchlink:operation,
  launchlink:defaultdir, transition, duration, openmode
- hidetoolbar, hidemenubar, hidewindowui, fitwindow, centerwindow,
  displaydoctitle, nonfullscreenpagemode, direction, viewarea, viewclip,
  printarea, printclip
- bookmarkdest
- pagewidth, pageheight, artbox, bleedbox, cropbox, trimbox
- pdiusebox
- defaultrgb/rgb/cmyk

Removed functions:

The functions PDF_setgray*() and PDF_setrgbcolor*() are no longer available
except in the C language. These functions have been deprecated since PDFlib 4.
Workaround: use setcolor() instead.

Changes in the Java binding:

All float parameters have been changed to double, which may require
appropriate adjustments to the data types used in client code.

Deprecated in the C++ binding:

- The overloaded open() calls are no longer available.

- The unsupported method get_message() in the PDFlibException object has
  been replaced with get_errmsg().

Changes in the PHP binding:

- Stricter parameter checking: detects bad data types

- Optional parameters are no longer supported (all parameters dictated by
  the API must be provided in the PHP script).

Changes related to encodings:

The "host" encoding translates to "iso8859-1" on non-Windows platforms
(except EBCDIC-based mainframes) instead of "winansi". It is still
recommended to explicitly specify the required encoding instead of
using "host".



PDFlib 5.0.2
============
- COM:
  - The functions PDF_setgray*() and PDF_setrgbcolor*() are no longer
    available in the COM wrapper. These functions have been deprecated
    since PDFlib 4. Workaround: use setcolor() instead.


PDFlib 5.0.1
============
- No changes which affect compatibility.


PDFlib 5.0.0
============

Deprecated functions:

- PDF_findfont()
- PDF_setpolydash()
- PDF_open_image_file()
- PDF_open_CCITT()
- PDF_open_image()
- PDF_place_pdi_page()
- PDF_boot_dll() and PDF_shutdown_dll()


Deprecated options for particular functions:

- reftype option in PDF_load_image()


Deprecated parameters:

- prefix


Other changes:

- Several resource configuration mechanism are superseded by improved
  mechanisms. However, the previous configuration scheme is still supported.

- Introduced a dedicated PDFlibException class for Java. This may
  require modifications to existing catch clauses.

- The new C exception handling with PDF_TRY/PDF_CATCH makes old-style
  error handlers obsolete. However, PDF_new2() will still accept error
  handler callbacks.

- The PDF_open_pdi_callback() has been slightly modified; this affects
  only PDFlib customers who used this feature in a preliminary release.

- Changed the default value of the "inheritgstate" parameter to false.

- By default, PDFlib generates PDF 1.4 (Acrobat 5) output. This can be
  modified with

  PDF_set_parameter(p, "compatibility", "1.3");

- The following features have been removed:

  PDF_set_parameter(p, "compatibility", "1.2");

  Careful programming can still produce PDF 1.2 compatible documents,
  albeit with a PDF 1.3 header entry.

- The following functions have been removed:

  PDF_open_pdi_mem() (only implemented in custom versions of PDFlib+PDI)
  Change existing calls to the following sequence:

  PDF_create_pvf(...);
  PDF_open_pdi(...);

- C++ binding:
  Switches to new-style C++ exceptions by default (as opposed to installing
  an old-style client-supplied error handler callback function).

- PHP binding:
  Those very old API functions have been removed from the wrapper which
  stemmed from the prehistoric era before PDFlib GmbH officially supported
  the PHP wrapper. These functions have never been documented in the PDFlib
  manual, but have been kept in the PHP wrapper for compatibility reasons.
  In order to facilitate maintenance we dropped these functions.
 
  The pdf_open_memory_image() API is not affected since it actually added
  new functionality. Although PDFlib GmbH does not support this function it
  still works.

  The virtual_dir support has also been dropped. This feature is rather
  confusing since it is not supported on all platforms and configurations.
  In addition, it conflicts with the new SearchPatch facility in PDFlib.
  Finally, it didn't work when generating PDF files with PDF_open_file().
