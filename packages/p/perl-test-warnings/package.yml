summary: Test::Warnings - Test for warnings and the lack of them
description: |
    This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan, or not, and things will still Just Work.
