summary: ExtUtils::Depends - Easily build XS extensions that depend on XS extensions
description: |
    This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means that a perl extension is treated like a shared library that provides also a C and an XS interface besides the perl one.
