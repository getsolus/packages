summary: Test::Most - Most commonly needed test functions and features
description: |
    Test::Most exists to reduce boilerplate and to make your testing life easier. We provide "one stop shopping" for most commonly used testing modules. In fact, we often require the latest versions so that you get bug fixes through Test::Most and don't have to keep upgrading these modules separately.
