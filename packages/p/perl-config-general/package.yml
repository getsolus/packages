summary: Perl Generic Config Module
description: |
    This module opens a config file and parses its contents for you. The new method requires one parameter which needs to be a filename. The method getall returns a hash which contains all options and its associated values of your config file. The format of config files supported by Config::General is inspired by the well known Apache config format, in fact, this module is 100% compatible to Apache configs, but you can also just use simple name/value pairs in your config files. In addition to the capabilities of an Apache config file it supports some enhancements such as here-documents, C-style comments or multiline options.
