summary: Exporter::Tiny - an exporter with the features of Sub::Exporter but only core dependencies
description: |
    Exporter::Tiny supports many of Sub::Exporter's external-facing features including renaming imported functions with the `-as`, `-prefix` and `-suffix` options; explicit destinations with the `into` option; and alternative installers with the `installer` option. But it's written in only about 40% as many lines of code and with zero non-core dependencies.
builddeps:
    - perl-test-fatal
    - perl-test-warnings
    - perl-try-tiny
