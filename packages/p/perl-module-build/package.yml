summary    : Build and install Perl modules
description: |
    Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl modules. It is meant to be an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in a much more straightforward way than with MakeMaker. It also does not require a make on your system - most of the Module::Build code is pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform way.
