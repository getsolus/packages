summary: Coreutils Progress Viewer
description: |
    progress is a tiny, dirty, C command that looks for coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar,
    gzip/gunzip, cat, etc.) currently running on your system and displays the percentage of copied
    data. It can also show estimated time and throughput, and provides a "top-like" mode
    (monitoring).
