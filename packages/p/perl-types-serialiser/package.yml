summary: Types::Serialiser - simple data types for common serialisation formats
description: |
    This module provides some extra datatypes that are used by common serialisation formats such as JSON or CBOR. The idea is to have a repository of simple/small constants and containers that can be shared by different implementations so they become interoperable between each other.
