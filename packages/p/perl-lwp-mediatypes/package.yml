summary: LWP::MediaTypes - guess media type for a file or a URL
description: |
    This module provides functions for handling media (also known as MIME) types and encodings. The mapping from file extensions to media types is defined by the media.types file. If the ~/.media.types file exists it is used instead. For backwards compatibility we will also look for ~/.mime.types.
