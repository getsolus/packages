summary: LWP::Protocol::https - Provide https support for LWP::UserAgent
description: |
    The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using https schemed URLs with LWP. This module is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
