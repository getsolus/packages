description: |
    The proc filesystem provides useful insight into the internals of Linux processes. One area of interest is the memory usage of files (e.g. databases, libraries, caches) at run-time. Each running process has a file located at /proc/[PID]/maps that catalogs the mapped memory regions in use by the process. A significant portion of these mapped regions will be the files in use by the process.
