summary     : Perl URI class module
component   : programming.perl
description : |
    This module implements the URI class. Objects of this class represent "Uniform Resource Identifier references" as specified in RFC 2396 (and updated by RFC 2732). A Uniform Resource Identifier is a compact string of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource. A Uniform Resource Identifier can be further classified as either a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a Uniform Resource Name (URN). The distinction between URL and URN does not matter to the URI class interface. A "URI-reference" is a URI that may have additional information attached in the form of a fragment identifier.
