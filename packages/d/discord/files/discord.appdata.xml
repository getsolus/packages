    <p>Discord is a free all in one messaging, voice, and video client thats available on your computer and phone.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re part of a school club, gaming group, worldwide art community, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to talk every day and hang out more often.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Talk to your friends with messaging, voice, and video in a "Direct Message" (1 other person), group chat (up to 10 people), or a multi-channel server (practically infinite maximum members).</li>
      <li>Discord servers are organized into topic-based channels where you can collaborate, share, and just talk about your day without clogging up a group chat.</li>
      <li>Grab a seat in a voice channel when you’re free. Friends in your server can see you’re around and instantly pop in to talk without having to call.</li>
      <li>Get a community of any size running with moderation tools and custom member access. Give members special powers, set up private channels, and more.</li>
      <li>Low-latency voice and video feels like you’re in the same room. Wave hello over video, watch friends stream their games, or gather up and have a drawing session with screen share.</li>
      <li>Available on Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and your web browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Discord is written in Javascript, React, Elixir, and Rust. The desktop application uses the electron framework.</p>
    <p>The flatpak version runs in a sandbox to provide better safety and privacy for users. However, this sandboxing prevents the following features from working out of the box: Game Activity, Unrestricted File Access, Rich Presence. Check the README in the Github repo for details.</p>
