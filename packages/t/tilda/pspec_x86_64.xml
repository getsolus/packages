        <Summary xml:lang="en">Tilda Terminal Emulator</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Tilda is a terminal emulator and can be compared with other popular terminal emulators such as gnome-terminal (Gnome), Konsole (KDE), xterm and many others. The specialities of Tilda are that it does not behave like a normal window but instead it can be pulled up and down from the top of the screen with a special hotkey. Additionally Tilda is highly configurable. It is possible to configure the hotkeys for keybindings, change the appearance and many options that affect the behavior of Tilda.
