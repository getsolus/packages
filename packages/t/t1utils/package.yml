description: |
    T1utils is a collection of simple programs for manipulating PostScript Type 1 fonts. Together, they allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB (binary) formats, disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable form, and reassemble them into PFA or PFB format. Additionally you can extract font resources from a Macintosh font file or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a PFA or PFB font.
