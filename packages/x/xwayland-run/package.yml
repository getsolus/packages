    xwayland-run contains a set of small utilities revolving around running Xwayland and various Wayland compositor headless.
    It provides:
     - xwayland-run, to spawn an X11 client within its own dedicated Xwayland rootful instance,
     - wlheadless-run to run a Wayland client on a set of supported Wayland headless compositors, and
     - xwfb-run, a combination of the two other tools above to be used as a direct replacement for xvfb-run specifically.
