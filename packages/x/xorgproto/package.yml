description: |
    This package provides the headers and specification documents defining the core protocol and (many) extensions for the X Window System. The extensions are those common among servers descended from X.Org 6.7. It also includes a number of headers that aren't purely protocol related, but are depended upon by many other X Window System packages to provide common definitions and porting layer.
