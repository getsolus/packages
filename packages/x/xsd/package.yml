summary: CodeSynthesis XSD is an W3C XML Schema to C++ data binding compiler
description: |
    CodeSynthesis XSD is an open-source, cross-platform W3C XML Schema to C++ data binding compiler. Provided with an XML instance specification (XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as well as XML parsing and serialization code. You can then access the data stored in XML using types and functions that semantically correspond to your application domain rather than dealing with the intricacies of reading and writing XML.
